mod.dimension-shard.displayName=Dimension Shard
mod.dimension-shard.description=(This mod is on develop, Please BACKUP your data before using this unstable mod!)\n\
\n\
There must be a war in a higher dimension. We found some kind of shards in a wreckage.\n\
These shard look illusory and contain power beyond the dimension we are in.\n\
The reasonable use of it seems to be able to manipulate time and space...\n\
We named it "Dimension Shard."\n\
