mod.dimension-shard.displayName = Dimension Shard
mod.dimension-shard.description = (This mod is on develop, Please BACKUP your data before using this unstable mod!)\n\
\n\
There must be a war in a higher dimension. We found some kind of shards in a wreckage.\n\
These shard look illusory and contain power beyond the dimension we are in.\n\
The reasonable use of it seems to be able to manipulate time and space...\n\
We named it "Dimension Shard."\n\

msg.dimension-shard.welcomeText = \
Welcome to play "Dimensional Shard"! \n\
This Mod strives for balance and has some unique mechanisms such as remote resource extraction and delivery, units with skills, etc. \n\
This Mod uses the gimmick of "Dimensional War Wreckage" as a gimmick to introduce time and space technology as the story background. \n\
\n\
[yellow]Note for new players[]:\n\
- When the relevant core is not built, the building of the corresponding technology will not be displayed in the construction list (currently only the Dimensional Core)\n\
- This Mod is a pure JavaScript Mod, so it is likely to cause the Mod to crash when the game is updated, [yellow] So please remember to backup and save every time the game is updated! []\n\
